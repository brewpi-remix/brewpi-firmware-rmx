Copyright (c) 2007, Jim Studt  (original old version - many contributors since)

The latest version of this library may be found at:
  http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html

OneWire has been maintained by Paul Stoffregen (paul@pjrc.com) since
January 2010.  At the time, it was in need of many bug fixes, but had
been abandoned the original author (Jim Studt).  None of the known
contributors were interested in maintaining OneWire.  Paul typically
works on OneWire every 6 to 12 months.  Patches usually wait that
long.  If anyone is interested in more actively maintaining OneWire,
please contact Paul.

Version 2.2:
  Teensy 3.0 compatibility, Paul Stoffregen, paul@pjrc.com
  Arduino Due compatibility, http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php?topic=141030
  Fix DS18B20 example negative temperature
  Fix DS18B20 example's low res modes, Ken Butcher
  Improve reset timing, Mark Tillotson
  Add const qualifiers, Bertrik Sikken
  Add initial value input to crc16, Bertrik Sikken
  Add target_search() function, Scott Roberts

Version 2.1:
  Arduino 1.0 compatibility, Paul Stoffregen
  Improve temperature example, Paul Stoffregen
  DS250x_PROM example, Guillermo Lovato
  PIC32 (chipKit) compatibility, Jason Dangel, dangel.jason AT gmail.com
  Improvements from Glenn Trewitt:
  - crc16() now works
  - check_crc16() does all of calculation/checking work.
  - Added read_bytes() and write_bytes(), to reduce tedious loops.
  - Added ds2408 example.
  Delete very old, out-of-date readme file (info is here)

Version 2.0: Modifications by Paul Stoffregen, January 2010:
http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html
  Search fix from Robin James
    http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1238032295/27#27
  Use direct optimized I/O in all cases
  Disable interrupts during timing critical sections
    (this solves many random communication errors)
  Disable interrupts during read-modify-write I/O
  Reduce RAM consumption by eliminating unnecessary
    variables and trimming many to 8 bits
  Optimize both crc8 - table version moved to flash

Modified to work with larger numbers of devices - avoids loop.
Tested in Arduino 11 alpha with 12 sensors.
26 Sept 2008 -- Robin James
http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1238032295/27#27

Updated to work with arduino-0008 and to include skip() as of
2007/07/06. --RJL20

Modified to calculate the 8-bit CRC directly, avoiding the need for
the 256-byte lookup table to be loaded in RAM.  Tested in arduino-0010

Jim Studt's original library was modified by Josh Larios.
