Before we proceed, a huge thank you to [Elco Jacobs](https://github.com/elcojacobs), without whom none of this would be possible.

This is [@LBussy](https://github.com/lbussy)'s forks of the original [BrewPi Project](https://github.com/BrewPi).  This project has a new website, please also visit https://www.brewpiremix.com.

This repository contains the firmware source code and compiled firmware for [BrewPi Remix](https://www.brewpiremix.com) which runs on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), communicating with an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/introduction).  

These [forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) are intended for the fans of the *original* BrewPi (called "Legacy" in BrewPi circles).  For current [BrewPi Spark 3](https://www.brewpi.com/) information and support, please continue to use and support [the original project](https://github.com/BrewPi).

# Getting Started

To get started, please head over to the [BrewPi Remix Tools](https://github.com/brewpi-remix/brewpi-tools-rmx/blob/master/README.md) README page, and follow along there.

# Compiling Source Code

It is not necessary to compile your own firmware.  If you desire simply to obtain the firmware, you can download it compiled for your controller on the [releases page](https://github.com/lbussy/brewpi-firmware-rmx/releases).

If you wish however to compile this project, beginning with version 0.2.11 it has been moved to [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) on top of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  Install PlatformIO on the platform of your choice, clone this repository, and open the workspace by navigating to the local repository.
