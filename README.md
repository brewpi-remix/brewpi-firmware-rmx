*[@LBussy](https://github.com/lbussy)'s forks of the original [BrewPi Project](https://github.com/BrewPi)*.  This project has a new website, please also visit https://www/brewpiremix.com.  All code will remain here, the website is just to make it easier for me to keep current information available.

This repository contains the Arduino firmware for [BrewPi Legacy Remix](https://www.brewpi.com/this-is-brewpi-0-2/) which runs on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), communicating with an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/introduction).  

These [forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) are intended for the fans of the *original* BrewPi (called "Legacy" in BrewPi circles).  For current [BrewPi Spark 3](https://www.brewpi.com/) information and support, please continue to use and support [the original project](https://github.com/BrewPi) which by all accounts is far more capable.

Before we proceed, a huge thank you to [Elco Jacobs](https://github.com/elcojacobs), without whom none of this would be possible.
# Getting Started

To get started, please head over to the [BrewPi Legacy Remix tools](https://github.com/lbussy/brewpi-tools-rmx/blob/master/README.md) README page, and follow along there.

It is not necessary to compile your own firmware.  If you desire simply to obtain the firmware, you can download it compiled for your controller on the [releases page](https://github.com/lbussy/brewpi-firmware-rmx/releases).
